# Create a Token

In this assessment, I developed a Solidity smart contract that enables the minting and burning of Tokens using the mint and burn function. We have also mapped addresses to unsigned integer.

## Description

The solidity code contains the basic structure like variables and functions. we have three public variables(tokenname, tokenAbbrv, totalSupply) and two functions, mint and burn that mints and burns as many tokens as we pass on to them.

### Executing program

The following code can be executed by copying and pasting the code in RemixIDE, and simply compiling and deploying it

/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenname = "YASH"; 
    string public tokenAbbrv = "YAS"; 
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint (address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value; 
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }
    // burn function
    function burn (address _address, uint _value) public { 
        if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
            totalSupply -= _value; 
            balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
    }
}
```
